## 💭 WHY THIS MATTERS

**Transparency = Accountability**

Surveillance cameras collect data on everyone, every day, everywhere they're deployed. Without transparency:
- Federal agencies access data without local knowledge
- No accountability for who searches the data or why
- Communities unaware of surveillance scope
- Civil liberties threatened without oversight

**Your request helps:**
- Expose unauthorized access
- Protect vulnerable communities
- Ensure lawful operation
- Inform public debate about surveillance
