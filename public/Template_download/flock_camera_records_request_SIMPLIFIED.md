## PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST

**Submission Checklist:**
☐ Fill in all [PLACEHOLDERS]  
☐ Add camera locations and technology types  
☐ Verify department contact info  
☐ Set time periods  
☐ Keep copy for records  
☐ Document submission date

**Legal Support:**
If denied based on privacy concerns, reference the Skagit County Superior Court ruling (*Rodriguez v. City of Sedro Woolley*, Nov. 2025) that confirmed surveillance data is subject to RCW 42.56. The court found that "broad and indiscriminate" surveillance collection does not create a privacy exemption.

**Key Issues to Monitor:**
Based on recent UW findings, many WA agencies may be unaware of federal access to their surveillance systems. Your request helps ensure transparency and accountability regarding who accesses this data.
