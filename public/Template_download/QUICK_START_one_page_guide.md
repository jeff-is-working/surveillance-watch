## ⏰ WHAT TO EXPECT

- ✅ Provide records

- ✅ Deny (must cite specific exemption)

**Day 6:** No response? Send follow-up
**Day 10:** Still nothing? Escalate to department head

## 🛡️ IF DENIED FOR "PRIVACY"

**Use this response:**

```
I am appealing this denial. In November 2025, Skagit County 
Superior Court ruled in Rodriguez v. City of Sedro Woolley 
that surveillance camera data MUST be released under RCW 42.56. 
The judge specifically rejected privacy arguments, finding 
the surveillance is "so broad and indiscriminate" that the 
data must be disclosed.

Please reverse the denial and provide the records within 
10 business days.
```

## 🚨 KEY FINDING: FEDERAL ACCESS

A University of Washington report (October 2025) found:
- **8+ WA agencies** directly shared data with Border Patrol
- **10+ WA agencies** had unauthorized "back door" federal access
- Auburn & Lakewood were **unaware** and revoked access
- Data used to track abortion seekers and immigrants

**That's why network audit logs are crucial!**
