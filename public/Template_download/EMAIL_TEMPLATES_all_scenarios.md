## 📧 TEMPLATE 4: APPEAL OF PRIVACY-BASED DENIAL

**Use when:** Agency denies request citing privacy concerns

**To:** [Department Head/Police Chief]  
**Cc:** [Public records officer, City attorney if known]  
**Subject:** APPEAL - Denial of Public Records Request Based on Privacy

```
Dear [Chief/Sheriff/Department Head],

I am formally appealing the denial of my public records request dated 
[DATE] regarding surveillance camera systems operated by [DEPARTMENT NAME].

BACKGROUND:
Your agency denied my request on [DATE], citing privacy concerns and 
[specific exemption if cited].

LEGAL BASIS FOR APPEAL:

1. CONTROLLING COURT PRECEDENT:
On November 7, 2025, Skagit County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Yost 
Neidzwski ruled in Rodriguez v. City of Sedro Woolley that surveillance 
camera data collected by law enforcement agencies qualifies as public 
records subject to the Washington Public Records Act (RCW 42.56).

2. COURT'S SPECIFIC FINDING:
The judge found that the scope of surveillance is "so broad and 
indiscriminate" — with most images capturing people not suspected of 
any crime — that the data MUST be released under public records law.

3. REJECTION OF PRIVACY ARGUMENTS:
The court explicitly rejected the same privacy-based arguments your 
agency is now asserting. The cities of Sedro Woolley and Stanwood made 
identical arguments about privacy violations and potential harm. The 
court found these arguments insufficient to withhold the records.

4. STATEWIDE IMPLICATIONS:
This ruling affects dozens of Washington police departments using 
surveillance technology. Both cities involved have since turned off 
their camera systems rather than comply with transparency requirements.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF:
I respectfully request that you:

1. IMMEDIATELY REVERSE the denial of my public records request
2. PROVIDE the requested surveillance camera records within ten (10) 
   business days
3. If you believe specific information is exempt, CITE the specific 
   RCW 42.56 exemption (other than privacy) and EXPLAIN how it applies

CONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUED DENIAL:
Failure to comply with this appeal may result in:
- Complaint to the Washington Attorney General's office
- Potential legal action under RCW 42.56.550
- Penalties against the agency ($5-$100 per day)
- Recovery of attorney fees if legal action is successful
- Public reporting on your department's lack of transparency

I remain willing to work cooperatively to ensure appropriate transparency 
while addressing any legitimate concerns you may have.

Please respond to this appeal within ten (10) business days.

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS]
[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]
[YOUR MAILING ADDRESS]

Attachments:
- Original Request
- Agency's Denial Letter
- News coverage of Rodriguez v. Sedro Woolley ruling (optional)

## 📧 TEMPLATE 5: REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION

**Use when:** Agency asks you to clarify or narrow your request

**To:** [Public records officer]  
**Subject:** RE: Clarification of Public Records Request - [Date]

```
Dear Public Records Officer,

Thank you for your email dated [DATE] requesting clarification of my 
public records request.

To address your questions:

[Answer their specific questions clearly. Examples below:]

Q: What specific time period are you requesting?
A: I am requesting records from [START DATE] to present, or if your 
surveillance program predates [START DATE], from the inception of the 
program to present.

Q: Are you requesting records about all cameras or specific locations?
A: I am requesting records about all surveillance cameras operated by 
[DEPARTMENT NAME], with particular interest in the cameras located at:
- [Location 1]
- [Location 2]
- [Location 3]

Q: What do you mean by "network audit logs"?
A: Network audit logs are the records maintained by surveillance 
system vendors (such as Flock Safety) showing every search performed 
on your surveillance data, including: who performed the search, when 
it was performed, what was searched for, and the stated reason for 
the search.

[Continue answering their questions...]

PRIORITIZATION:
If providing all requested items would result in excessive delay or 
cost, please prioritize the following items for immediate response:

1. Complete list/map of all surveillance camera locations
2. Contracts with surveillance technology vendors
3. Current policies governing camera use and data sharing
4. Network audit logs for the past [time period]
5. Records of federal agency access

I am willing to receive records on a rolling basis as they become 
available, rather than waiting for the entire request to be completed.

Please let me know if you need any additional clarification. I remain 
committed to working cooperatively while preserving my rights under 
RCW 42.56.

Thank you,

[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS]
[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]

## 📧 TEMPLATE 6: FEE WAIVER REQUEST

**Use when:** Agency quotes a fee that seems too high

**To:** [Public records officer]  
**Subject:** Fee Waiver Request - Public Records Request [Date]

```
Dear Public Records Officer,

Thank you for your response dated [DATE] providing a cost estimate of 
$[AMOUNT] for my public records request regarding surveillance camera 
systems.

I am formally requesting a waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to 
RCW 42.56.120(3) on the following grounds:

1. PUBLIC INTEREST:
This request serves a significant public interest by:
- Ensuring transparency regarding government surveillance programs
- Allowing public oversight of law enforcement technology
- Informing the community about surveillance in their neighborhoods
- Verifying compliance with state law prohibiting immigration enforcement 
  cooperation (RCW 10.93.160)

2. NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSE:
This request is for personal use to understand surveillance in my 
community. It is not for any commercial purpose. Any information 
obtained will be used to promote government accountability and public 
awareness.

3. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE:
Given:
- The November 2025 Skagit County court ruling on surveillance transparency
- The October 2025 University of Washington report revealing unauthorized 
  federal access to Washington surveillance systems
- Widespread public concern about surveillance and civil liberties

Disclosure of this information contributes significantly to public 
understanding of government operations and is clearly in the public interest.

4. REQUEST FOR COST BREAKDOWN:
Please provide a detailed breakdown of the estimated cost:
- Number of pages/documents to be copied
- Copying cost per page
- Staff time allocated (by task)
- Hourly rate for staff time

Note: RCW 42.56.120(3) specifically prohibits charging for:
- Staff time to search and compile records
- Legal review or redaction time

5. ALTERNATIVE FORMAT:
I am willing to accept records in electronic format (PDF via email or 
file transfer) to minimize or eliminate copying costs.

6. NARROWED REQUEST:
If cost remains prohibitive even after fee waiver consideration, I am 
willing to discuss narrowing my request to focus on the most essential 
items, particularly:
- Camera location inventory
- Vendor contracts
- Network audit logs
- Policies on data sharing

Please reconsider the fee in light of the public interest factors and 
statutory limitations on allowable charges.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS]
[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]

you indicate do not exist.

**Subject:** Request for Redaction Justification and Index

Dear Public Records Officer,

Thank you for providing records dated [DATE] in response to my public

I note substantial redactions throughout the documents. RCW 42.56.210 
requires agencies to provide a statement of the exemption authorizing 
the withholding and an explanation of how it applies to the records 
being withheld.

Please provide:

1. REDACTION INDEX:
For each redacted portion, please provide:

     redacted content

If entire documents were withheld, please provide a privilege log 
listing:

   - Exemption(s) claimed

Please confirm that you have provided all non-exempt portions of 
responsive records and that redactions represent the minimum necessary 
to protect legitimately exempt information.

4. SPECIFIC CONCERNS:
I note the following redactions that appear questionable:
[List specific examples, such as:]
   - Page 3: Entire paragraph redacted regarding camera locations 
     (locations should not be exempt)
   - Page 7: Vendor name redacted (contract information is public)
   - Page 12: Cost information redacted (budget data is public)

Please provide either the unredacted information or specific explanation 
for why these particular items are exempt.

I reserve the right to appeal specific redactions once I understand 
the basis for them.

Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring appropriate transparency.

Sincerely,
