## 🎯 INTRODUCTION - WHY THIS MATTERS {#introduction}

### What's Happening in Washington State

Law enforcement agencies across Washington are deploying surveillance camera systems that:
- Automatically photograph every vehicle that passes by
- Capture images of drivers and passengers
- Store this data for weeks or months
- Share data with other agencies, including federal immigration enforcement

**Recent developments:**
- A November 2024 court ruling confirmed this data is public record
- A University of Washington report revealed federal agencies accessed local surveillance systems without agencies' knowledge
- Several cities have paused or shut down camera programs due to transparency concerns

### Your Right to Know

Under Washington's Public Records Act (RCW 42.56), you have the **legal right** to request information about:
- What surveillance systems your city or county uses
- Where cameras are located
- Who has access to the data
- How the data is being used

**This guide will walk you through the entire process**, step by step, so you can exercise your rights and bring transparency to surveillance in your community.

## ✅ BEFORE YOU START - WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW {#before-you-start}

### What You'll Need

- ✅ Email address (preferred) or mailing address
- ✅ Phone number (optional but helpful)
- ✅ 15-30 minutes to prepare your request
- ✅ The templates provided (downloaded or copied)
- ✅ Basic information about your local police department

### What You DON'T Need

- ❌ A lawyer
- ❌ A special reason or justification
- ❌ To be a journalist or researcher
- ❌ To explain why you want the information
- ❌ To pay upfront (most electronic records are free or low-cost)

### Important Reassurances

**"Will I get in trouble?"**
No. Filing public records requests is a constitutional right protected by Washington law.

**"Will they know I'm investigating them?"**
Your request will be public record itself, but requesting information is completely legal and appropriate.

**"What if I don't know exactly what to ask for?"**
That's okay! The templates are designed to be comprehensive. You can also offer to clarify your request if the agency needs help understanding what you want.

**"I'm not good with legal stuff..."**
Don't worry! This guide uses plain language and walks you through everything step by step.

## 🔍 STEP 1: IDENTIFY YOUR LOCAL AGENCY {#step-1-identify-your-agency}

### Who to Contact

Surveillance cameras are typically operated by:
- **City Police Departments** (for cities like Olympia, Lacey, Tumwater)
- **County Sheriff's Offices** (for unincorporated areas)
- **Washington State Patrol** (for state highways)
- **Transit Agencies** (for buses and transit centers)
- **Housing Authorities** (for public housing)

### How to Find Your Agency

**If you live in a city:**
- Contact your city police department
- Example: "Olympia Police Department" or "Lacey Police Department"

**If you live in unincorporated county area:**
- Contact your county sheriff's office
- Example: "Thurston County Sheriff's Office"

**If you're concerned about multiple areas:**
- You can file separate requests with each agency
- Or start with one and expand based on what you learn

### Quick Lookup

**For Thurston County Residents:**
- **Olympia:** Olympia Police Department
- **Lacey:** Lacey Police Department
- **Tumwater:** Tumwater Police Department
- **Unincorporated areas:** Thurston County Sheriff's Office
- **Yelm:** Yelm Police Department
- **Rainier:** Thurston County Sheriff (contract services)

**Not sure who covers your area?**
- Call your city hall and ask: "Who provides police services in my area?"
- Or search online: "[Your City] police department"

## 📷 STEP 2: FIND SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN YOUR AREA {#step-2-find-cameras}

### Why This Matters

You'll get better results if you can identify specific camera locations, but it's not required. You can also request "all surveillance camera locations operated by [Department Name]."

### How to Spot Surveillance Cameras

**What to look for:**

**Flock Safety ALPR Cameras:**
- Small, square-ish boxes on poles
- Often at intersections or neighborhood entrances
- Usually have a small solar panel on top
- May have "Flock Safety" branding
- Common in residential neighborhoods

**Traditional ALPR (License Plate Readers):**
- Mounted on police patrol cars (mobile units)
- Fixed cameras on highway overpasses
- May be larger with multiple camera lenses

**Video Surveillance:**
- Traditional security-style cameras
- May be mounted on buildings or poles
- Could be part of city camera networks

### Document What You Find

**Make notes including:**
- Specific location (address or intersection)
- What type of camera you think it is
- Date you observed it
- Take a photo if safe to do so (from public property)

**Example notes:**
```
- Intersection of 4th Ave and Capitol Way, Olympia
- Small square camera on pole, appears to be Flock ALPR
- Observed on November 10, 2024
- Photo saved to phone
```

### Online Research

**Check local news:**
- Search: "[Your City] Flock cameras" or "[Your City] license plate readers"
- Local news often reports when cameras are installed

**City council meetings:**
- Check your city's website for council meeting agendas/minutes
- Search for "surveillance" "cameras" "Flock" "ALPR"

**Community social media:**
- Local Facebook groups or Nextdoor may have discussions
- Residents often notice and discuss new cameras

### If You Can't Find Specific Cameras

**That's okay!** You can still request:
- "All surveillance camera locations operated by [Department]"
- "Complete inventory of ALPR and video surveillance systems"
- "Maps showing all camera deployments"

The agency is required to search for and provide this information.

You have two template options. Choose based on your needs:

**Length:** 2 pages

**Use this if:** You're new to public records requests or want a simple, efficient approach.

### Option B: Comprehensive Template (FOR DETAILED INVESTIGATION)

**Best for:**

- When you want maximum information
- Follow-up after initial request

**What you'll get:**

Dear Public Records Officer,

Thank you for providing records in response to my request dated [Date]. I have a few follow-up questions:

1. I requested network audit logs but did not receive them. Can you confirm whether [Department] has access to these logs through your surveillance vendor?

[Your Name]

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS {#faq}

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need to be a resident of the city to request records?**
A: No. Anyone can request public records from any Washington agency, regardless of where you live.

**Q: Can I request records anonymously?**
A: No. You must provide contact information. However, your request itself becomes public, so others could see that you made it.

**Q: How much will this cost?**
A: Many agencies provide electronic records for free or minimal cost (under $10). Complex requests involving extensive copying or staff time may cost more. You can request a fee waiver.

**Q: What if I can't afford the fees?**
A: Include a fee waiver request in your initial submission. Argue that disclosure is in the public interest. Agencies often waive or reduce fees.

**Q: Can they refuse my request because I'm not a journalist?**
A: No. Any person has the right to request public records. You don't need to be a journalist, researcher, or have any special status.

**Q: Will this affect my relationship with law enforcement?**
A: Public records requests are a legal right. Agencies should not retaliate. If you experience harassment or retaliation, contact the ACLU of Washington.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What if I don't know the exact camera locations?**
A: Request "all surveillance camera locations" and ask for a complete inventory. The agency must search for this information.

**Q: What are "network audit logs"?**
A: These are records showing every search performed on the surveillance system - who searched, when, and why. They're crucial for accountability.

**Q: What's the difference between ALPR and video surveillance?**
A: ALPR = Automatic License Plate Readers (photographs license plates). Video surveillance = traditional cameras recording video. Both are covered by the templates.

**Q: Do I need to know what brand of cameras they use?**
A: No. The templates are broad enough to cover all brands. Just request "all surveillance camera systems" and list the common types.

**Q: What if they have cameras but say they don't?**
A: Ask them to document their search. If you have evidence cameras exist (news articles, photos, city council minutes), provide this and request they search again.

### Legal Questions

**Q: What if they cite a privacy exemption?**
A: Reference the November 2024 Skagit County court ruling that rejected privacy exemptions for broad surveillance. See the Troubleshooting section.

**Q: Can they charge me for their lawyer reviewing the records?**
A: No. RCW 42.56 specifically prohibits charging for legal review time.

**Q: What's a "Glomar response"?**
A: When an agency refuses to confirm or deny records exist. This is rarely appropriate and can be challenged.

**Q: How long do I have to appeal a denial?**
A: There's no specific deadline, but act promptly. Consider appeals within 30 days of denial.

**Q: Can I sue if they don't comply?**
A: Yes. RCW 42.56 allows for penalties if agencies improperly withhold records. Consult with an attorney or the ACLU-WA.

### Specific Concern Questions

**Q: How do I find out if ICE has accessed my city's cameras?**
A: Request "network audit logs" and specifically ask for "records of federal agency access including ICE, CBP, Border Patrol, HSI, FBI, DEA, and any other federal agencies."

**Q: What if my city doesn't have cameras yet but is considering them?**
A: Request: "All communications, proposals, contracts, and documents regarding consideration or evaluation of surveillance camera systems."

**Q: Can I request video footage of myself?**
A: Yes. You may have enhanced rights to access records specifically about yourself. Mention in your request if seeking your own information.

**Q: What about private cameras that police have access to (like Ring)?**
A: The templates cover this. Request "records of participation in Ring Neighbors Law Enforcement Portal or other private camera access programs."

**Q: How often should I file requests?**
A: You can file as often as you like, but be reasonable. Consider quarterly or semi-annual follow-up requests to track changes.

### Follow-Up Questions

**Q: What should I do with the information I receive?**
A: Options include:
- Share with local journalists
- Present findings at city council meetings
- Contact ACLU-WA or other advocacy groups
- Publish findings on social media (be responsible)
- File follow-up requests for more details

**Q: Can I share the records publicly?**
A: Generally yes - public records are public. However, be thoughtful about not exposing sensitive personal information. Redact license plates, faces, etc. if sharing images.

**Q: What if I find something concerning in the records?**
A: Contact:
- ACLU of Washington: www.aclu-wa.org
- Local journalists
- Your city council representatives
- Community advocacy groups

**Q: How do I know if the response is complete?**
A: Look for:
- Response to each item you requested
- Explanation if something is missing
- Reasonable completeness given your request
- If in doubt, file a follow-up clarification request

I have sent a follow-up email on Day 6 (attached), which also received no response.

Please ensure this request receives immediate attention and compliance with state law.

[Original request and follow-up attached]

Thank you,

### Issue 2: Denied for "Privacy Reasons"

**Problem:** Agency denies request claiming release would violate privacy.

**Solution:**

Respond with this appeal:

```
Subject: Appeal of Denial - Public Records Request [Date]

Dear [Department Head],

I am appealing the denial of my public records request dated [Date] regarding surveillance camera systems.

Your agency denied my request citing privacy concerns. However:

1. LEGAL PRECEDENT: In November 2024, Skagit County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski ruled in Rodriguez v. City of Sedro Woolley that surveillance camera data qualifies as public records subject to RCW 42.56.

2. COURT FINDING: The judge specifically found that the scope of surveillance is "so broad and indiscriminate" — with most images capturing people not suspected of any crime — that the data MUST be released under public records law.

3. REJECTED ARGUMENT: The court explicitly rejected the same privacy arguments you are now asserting.

The law is clear: this data is public record. I request that you:
- Immediately reverse the denial
- Provide the requested records within 10 business days
- Or provide the specific RCW 42.56 exemption you believe applies (other than privacy)

Failure to comply may result in further action, including filing a complaint with the Attorney General's office or seeking judicial review.

[Original request attached]

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### Issue 3: "We Don't Have Those Records"

**Problem:** Agency claims requested records don't exist, but you believe they do.

**Solution:**

Request documentation of their search:

```
Subject: Request for Adequate Search Documentation

Dear Public Records Officer,

Thank you for your response that certain requested records do not exist. To ensure an adequate search was conducted, please provide:

1. Documentation of the search performed (which systems/databases were searched, who performed the search, date of search)

2. Confirmation that you consulted with your surveillance system vendor (Flock Safety, etc.) regarding:
   - Network audit logs
   - User access records
   - System configuration settings

3. Explanation of why these records would not exist if you operate surveillance cameras

If the search was adequate and records truly don't exist, please provide this documentation so I can understand the scope of your search.

If the search was not adequate, please conduct a thorough search including consulting with vendors and IT staff.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### Issue 4: Excessive Fees

**Problem:** Agency quotes a fee that seems unreasonably high.

**Solution:**

Request fee waiver and cost breakdown:

```
Subject: Fee Waiver Request and Cost Breakdown

Dear Public Records Officer,

Thank you for your cost estimate of $[Amount]. I am requesting:

1. FEE WAIVER pursuant to RCW 42.56.120:
   - This request is in the public interest
   - It is not for commercial purposes
   - Disclosure will contribute to public understanding of government surveillance operations
   - Given the recent court ruling and UW report on unauthorized federal access, transparency regarding surveillance systems is of significant public importance

2. DETAILED COST BREAKDOWN:
   - Breakdown by category (copying, scanning, staff time)
   - Number of pages/hours for each category
   - Rate charged per page/hour
   - Which specific records contribute to the cost

Note: RCW 42.56.120(3) prohibits charging for staff time to redact or conduct legal review.

If you need me to narrow my request to reduce costs, please suggest which portions could be eliminated.

I am happy to accept records in electronic format to minimize costs.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### Issue 5: Excessive Delay

**Problem:** Agency provides a time estimate that seems unreasonably long (e.g., 6+ months).

**Solution:**

Request interim responses and justification:

```
Subject: Request for Interim Records and Delay Justification

Dear Public Records Officer,

Thank you for your response estimating [X months] to fulfill my request. To ensure this estimate is reasonable:

1. Please provide detailed justification for the estimated time:
   - Approximate number of responsive records
   - Staff resources allocated
   - Workflow process

2. Please provide records on a rolling basis as they become available, rather than waiting until all records are compiled.

3. Please prioritize the following items for immediate response:
   - Complete list/map of camera locations
   - Contracts with surveillance vendors
   - Current policies on camera use and data sharing

These items should be readily available and can be provided within 10 business days.

I understand complex requests take time, but several months for records about a surveillance program seems excessive. Please work to reduce this timeline or provide interim deliveries.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### Issue 6: Heavily Redacted Records

**Problem:** You receive records but large portions are redacted (blacked out).

**Solution:**

Request explanation of redactions:

```
Subject: Request for Redaction Justification

Dear Public Records Officer,

Thank you for providing records in response to my request. However, I note substantial redactions throughout the documents.

RCW 42.56.210 requires that redactions be explained. For each redacted portion, please provide:

1. The specific RCW 42.56 exemption authorizing the redaction
2. A brief explanation of how that exemption applies to the specific redacted content
3. Confirmation that you have provided all non-exempt portions

Please provide an index or log identifying:
- Document title/description
- Page number(s)
- Exemption(s) cited for each redaction
- Brief explanation

If you believe entire documents are exempt, please provide a privilege log listing the withheld documents and the exemptions claimed.

I reserve the right to appeal specific redactions once I understand the basis for them.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### Issue 7: Agency Asks for Clarification

**Problem:** Agency asks you to clarify or narrow your request.

**Solution:**

This is normal! Respond promptly:

```
Subject: RE: Clarification of Public Records Request

Dear Public Records Officer,

Thank you for your questions about my request. To clarify:

[Answer their specific questions clearly and directly]

To ensure we're aligned, my primary interest is in:
1. [Your top priority item]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

If providing all requested items would result in excessive delay or cost, please prioritize these items first and provide them on a rolling basis.

I remain willing to discuss the scope to ensure you understand what I'm seeking while preserving my rights under RCW 42.56.

Please let me know if you need any additional clarification.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### Issue 8: Agency Says "This is a Security Risk"

**Problem:** Agency claims releasing information would compromise security.

**Solution:**

Challenge this carefully:

```
Subject: Response to Security Concerns

Dear Public Records Officer,

I understand your security concerns. However:

1. The Skagit County court ruling addresses this exact argument and found it insufficient to withhold surveillance camera data.

2. If you believe specific information is exempt under RCW 42.56.240 (security records), you must:
   - Cite the specific subsection
   - Explain how disclosure would compromise security
   - Provide all non-exempt portions

3. General claims of "security risk" are insufficient. The exemption must apply to specific documents.

Please provide:
- All non-security-related records
- A privilege log for any records withheld
- Specific exemption citations

I am happy to discuss whether certain specific items (e.g., login credentials, encryption keys) might legitimately be withheld while still providing the bulk of requested information.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```
