## IMPORTANT RECENT LEGAL PRECEDENT

**Skagit County Superior Court Ruling (November 2025):**

Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski of Skagit County Superior Court recently ruled that surveillance camera data, including images captured by Flock cameras, qualifies as public records subject to Washington's Public Records Act (RCW 42.56). This landmark decision came after the cities of Sedro Woolley and Stanwood attempted to block public records requests by arguing that releasing surveillance images would violate privacy.

**Key Findings from the Court:**
- The judge found that the scope of surveillance was "so broad and indiscriminate" — with most images capturing people not suspected of any crime — that the data must be released under public records law
- The ruling specifically stated: "The Flock data do qualify as public records subject to the Public Records Act"
- This decision could affect dozens of Washington police departments using similar surveillance technology
- Both cities involved in the lawsuit have since turned off their camera systems

**Additional Context - Federal Access Concerns:**

A University of Washington Center for Human Rights report (October 2025) revealed that federal agents, including U.S. Border Patrol and ICE, had accessed Washington's surveillance camera networks, potentially in violation of state law prohibiting use of such systems for immigration enforcement. The report found:
- At least eight Washington law enforcement agencies enabled direct data sharing with Border Patrol
- At least ten agencies had "back door" access by Border Patrol without explicit authorization
- Several agencies, including Auburn and Lakewood, stated they were unaware of this access and have since revoked it
- Out-of-state law enforcement agencies conducted searches of Washington data, including searches related to abortion seekers

**Why This Matters for Your Request:**

This ruling establishes clear legal precedent that surveillance camera data collected by law enforcement in Washington State is subject to public disclosure under RCW 42.56. Agencies cannot claim privacy exemptions simply because the data includes images of individuals not suspected of crimes. This precedent strengthens your right to access this information and provides legal support if any agency attempts to deny your request on privacy grounds.
